Benchmark your WinDbg connection!

In WinDbg, run the following command to load the DLL
	`.load "C:\\path\\to\\bandwidth.dll"`

To invoke bandwidth, simply do `!bandwidth`. By default a 5 second benchmark
will be done on both physical and virtual read rates. Feel free to specify
a parameter `!bandwidth <time to benchmark in ms>` to customize the
benchmarking time. If the time specified is greater than 10000ms, the time
is set to 10000ms (aka, capped to 10 seconds). This is to prevent typos causing
you to wait for hours for a benchmark.

How is the benchmark done?

Chunks of BUF_SIZE are read until the time has elapsed. Then the bandwidth
is calculated based on how many bytes ended up being read in total.

The virtual benchmark starts at the instruction pointer.
The physical benchmark starts at offset 0x00000000`00000000.

Note:

This has not been tested on 32-bit WinDbg.
